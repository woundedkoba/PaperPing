# PaperPing
A fork of xDefcon's SpigotPing 3.0 Plugin

Want to see your in-game ping? With this plugin you can do this by typing /ping or by pressing TAB

PaperPing is a Paper plugin that allows you and your users to check their in-game ping with a simple command, /ping. The output message is customizable with prefix and colors by config. In addition to this you can enable sounds, and show players' ping in the Tab List (prefix/suffix).

Commands & Permissions:                                  
Permissions are checked only if you set "permission-system.enabled" in the config to true.
  - /ping (PaperPing.ping)
  - /ping <username> (PaperPing.ping.others)
  - /pingreload (PaperPing.reload)

This is the default ping message:

You can configure almost everything of the plugin, here is the current configuration file.                                 
Config file: https://github.com/woundedkoba/PaperPing/blob/main/src/main/resources/config.yml

PaperPing 0.0.1 was created because Minecraft 1.20.5, 1.20.6, and 1.21 broke how xDefcon's SpigotPing 3.0 was acquiring the Minecraft Version. Starting with Minecraft 1.20.5 Java 21 is required. I assume this to be what caused the breaking issue.

All credit to xDefcon for all original work. I only take credit for having updated this plugin for MC 1.20.6 & 1.21 and other items listed below.

See docs > Change Log.md for Changes made in each version.
