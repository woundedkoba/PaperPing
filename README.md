# PaperPing
A fork of xDefcon's SpigotPing 3.0 Plugin

Want to see your in-game ping? With this plugin you can do this by typing /ping or by pressing TAB

SpigotPing is a Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugin that allows you and your users to check their in-game ping with a simple command, /ping. The output message is customizable with prefix and colors by config. In addition to this you can enable sounds, and show players' ping in the Tab List (prefix/suffix).
